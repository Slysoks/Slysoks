# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Slysoks

I was born on 2009. Since I was still a child, I've always been passionate about computers and technology. I started programming at the age of 10, when my father showed me Scratch, by the MIT. That was the beginning of my journey in the programming world. I next created basic programs in Python. That's were I discovered my passion for programming without any graphical interface.

Next, I started learning HTML and CSS with [Magic Makers](https://www.magicmakers.fr/). Then I learned a bit of JavaScript. My favorite game is and will always be Minecraft. One day, I saw a video of a guy who created a Minecraft launcher. I was so impressed that I decided to create my own. That's how I discovered the magic of Node.js with electron.
