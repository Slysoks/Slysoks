# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Slysoks

## Biography
I was born in 2009 and I'm a French student from Joliot-Curie High School in Rennes. Since I was a child, I've always been passionate about computers and technology. I also practice tennis and love spatial sciences. I'm a big fan of SpaceX and their innovations, such as reusable rockets and their Starship rocket. I love video games such as Minecraft, Rocket League, and many more.

## My Journey

### 1 - The Beginning
I started programming at the age of 10 when my father showed me the Scratch programming interface by MIT. That was the beginning of my journey in the programming world. Next, I created basic programs in Python. That's where I discovered my passion for programming without any graphical interface.

### 2 - The Discovery of the Web
A few moments later, I started learning HTML and CSS with [Magic Makers](https://www.magicmakers.fr/). Then I learned a bit of JavaScript. My favorite game is and will always remain Minecraft. One day, I saw a video of a guy who created a Minecraft launcher. I was so impressed that I decided to create my own. That's how I discovered the magic of Node.js with Electron, and here's the beginning of everything.

### 3 - Node.js, the Renewal
I next created a basic React app with Vite. I discovered the routes, the widgets, and many more different things. Right after that, I created a Discord bot with Discord.js. I learned how to use APIs and how to create a bot.

### 4 - Papillon
A few months ago, I invested myself in the creation of a better React Native app, [Papillon](https://github.com/PapillonApp/Papillon). It's a mobile app that allows you to get your school information with a much better interface than the official one. I joined this open-source project as a collaborator in April 2024. I learned a lot about React Native and how to create a mobile app.
