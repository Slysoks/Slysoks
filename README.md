                Hi, I'm Slysoks and I was born on March 15 2009. My real name is Nathan. 
                Since I was still a child, I've always been passionate about computers and technology.
                I started programming at the age of 10, when my father showed me Scratch, by the MIT.
                That was the beginning of my journey in the programming world. I next created basic
                programs in Python. That's were I discovered my passion for programming without
                any graphical interface.
                <br>
                <br>
                Next, I started learning HTML and CSS with
                <a 
                    href="https://www.magicmakers.fr/"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="
                        underline-animation
                        text-link
                    "
                >
                    Magic Makers
                </a>.
                Then I learned a bit of JavaScript. My favorite game is and will always be Minecraft.
                One day, I saw a video of a guy who created a Minecraft launcher. I was so impressed
                that I decided to create my own. That's how I discovered the magic of Node.js with
                electron.
